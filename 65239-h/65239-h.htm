<p class="ph3">BY ONE ON THE SPOT.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> gold-fields of the Transvaal, which have been
heard of by fits and starts during the last twelve
years, have of late begun to excite considerable
attention both at home and in South Africa;
and as the future of the Transvaal, and indeed
a great portion of South-eastern Africa, depends
very much on their proper development, a short
description of the gold-bearing region may prove
interesting to readers of this <i>Journal</i>.</p>

<p>Gold has been found scattered over a considerable
extent of country here, and indeed is known
to extend up to the Zambesi; but the part most
frequented by the gold-seeker is a belt of country
running almost north and south, commencing on
the Kaap River, a few miles east of the village
of Middleburg, in the Transvaal, and terminating
about ten miles north of Pilgrim’s Rest, in the
Lydenburg district. The principal ‘farms’ on
which gold has been found in the Lydenburg
district are Pilgrim’s Rest, Berlin, Lisbon,
Graskop, Mac-Mac, Spitzkop, Elandsdrift, and
Hendriksdal&mdash;these so-called ‘farms’ being merely
tracts of ground surveyed, but in scarcely any
case used for actual farming purposes. There
are numerous other ‘farms’ on which gold has
been found; but the above-named have, up to
the present time, produced the largest quantity.
From the Kaap River gold-fields, about fifty miles
from Lydenburg, a considerable quantity of gold
has also been extracted, partly on unallotted
government ground, and partly from the ‘farms’
of private owners; but this district has not been
so extensively worked of late, owing to its unhealthiness
in the lower reaches of the river,
and also to the difficulty of working in such a
broken country.</p>

<p>At the present time, comparatively little work
is being carried on in either of the above districts,
from causes which will be explained presently;
but that gold exists in considerable quantities,
there is not the shadow of a doubt, as the returns
of banks and merchants for native gold purchased
can show; and although no capitalists have until
recently made their appearance on the gold-fields,
yet several exceptionally lucky diggers who came
here with nothing beyond experience and stout
hearts, have realised a competence, in spite of
the disadvantages and troubles which such a
rough life implies.</p>

<p>All the gold hitherto found, with very few
exceptions, has been of the kind known as alluvial&mdash;that
is, existing in the ground, and capable of
being extracted by means of water alone, without
the intervention of machinery; but at present
there are two Companies with machinery starting
work-crushing quartz, the returns from which
are looked forward to with much interest, as it
will then be seen whether it will pay to import
machinery on a large scale or not. When the
gold-bearing ground lies at a comparatively low
level, enabling water from any of the numerous
streams running through the country to be
brought on it, the process of gold-washing is
very simple, the ground being merely picked loose
and thrown into the water, or washed away by the
water, which is then conducted through a long
box, or race, about eighteen inches in width and
depth, open on top, and paved with hard rock or
quartz on the bottom, falling gradually for a distance
of from twenty to two hundred feet in length,
according to the strength of the stream running
through the ground, and the quantity of ground
washed per day. Once or twice a day the water
is turned off from this race and a small stream
of clean water run through it; the race is then
carefully examined from end to end; and any
nuggets or particles of gold which, by the action
of the water and their greater specific gravity,
may have been deposited in the ripples or inequalities
of the bottom-paving, are then picked up,
and the work resumed. In cases where the gold
is of a fine nature, and liable to be carried away
if the race alone were used, the coarser stones
are sifted from the ground, and the combined
ground and water run over coarse blankets, which,
from the nature of their texture, catch all the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">{178}</span>
fine particles of gold and allow the lighter soil
to flow away. These blankets are periodically
washed out; and the fine particles of gold resulting
are combined with quicksilver, which, from
its affinity to gold, brings the whole into one
mass, which is then placed in a retort, and the
quicksilver evaporated off and recaught for future
use, leaving the gold in a solid mass behind.</p>

<p>The above process, costing very little in the
way of outlay, has been of necessity almost the
only one adopted by the diggers, who for the most
part have been working-men, with little or no
money; and in cases where the alluvial ground
has lain so high above the level of the rivers as
to prevent it being worked in the same way, the
only difference has been that the ground has had
to be excavated and brought to the water-race by
carting or otherwise, the process of washing being
the same. But in the case of quartz containing
gold, the quartz has to be reduced almost to a
powder in water by means of machinery; the
crushed quartz then flows over plates coated with
quicksilver, which catch the greater part of the
gold; and that which escapes the quicksilver is
caught by means of the blankets before mentioned,
which receive it after passing the silvered
plates.</p>

<p>It has struck many people who are acquainted
with gold-mining in both Australia and California,
that in no two places in the Transvaal
are the indications of gold the same. In one
place it is in vain to look for it except on
the top of a hill; in another, the valley alone
will yield gold; and not a few geologists and
so-called mining experts who have visited the
gold-fields lately, for the purpose of reporting on
properties for intending purchasers, have been
much at fault regarding the possibility of finding
payable gold, and confessed that it is necessary
to spend a considerable time before a property
can be even cursorily examined. In most cases,
it seems that the diggers themselves, through their
actual experience, are better acquainted with the
payable and non-payable ground than any stranger,
however experienced otherwise, can be.</p>

<p>From 1873, the gold-laws of the Transvaal
permitted a digger to take out a license for a
claim on any gold-bearing property held to be
the property of the government, and the digger
paying the amount of this license for his right
to dig for gold. When a claim was exhausted or
found not payable, the digger was at liberty to
abandon it and mark out another, in the event
of this other not being occupied. This law, in
a sparsely populated country, where scarcely any
agriculture was carried on, worked very well and
harmoniously; but on the retrocession of the
Transvaal by the British government, a new order
of things sprang into existence. In order to
increase the revenue&mdash;which fell rapidly off on
the departure of the British government, and has
in consequence caused a widespread distress ever
since amongst those who were the first to rise
against British authority&mdash;the Volksraad or Boer
Parliament granted concessions for every manufacture
that could be carried on in the Transvaal&mdash;that
is, allowing one man, on the payment of
a certain sum per annum, the sole right to manufacture
spirits; another, gunpowder; another,
wool, &amp;c.&mdash;in each case imposing a countervailing
duty on articles of the same kind coming from
Europe, so as, if possible, to insure the sale of
the Transvaal-made article. It is to be remarked,
<i>en passant</i>, that the European articles, though
thus hampered, still continue to have by far the
largest sale. Amongst other concessions, a gold
concession law was passed, specifying that the
owner of any gold-bearing farm could, on the
payment of a sum to be agreed upon per annum,
obtain the sole right to work for gold on his farm,
on condition that he compensated any diggers who
might be on his property, working under the old
government license.</p>

<p>The consequence of the promulgation of this
last law has been that nearly every owner of a
gold-bearing farm who could pay a year or two’s
concession rental for his property, has taken out
a concession, with the idea of disposing of both
concession and farm at a high profit in the
European market, and in few cases with the
intention of digging for gold. As nothing is
stated in the gold concessions about the time in
which the original diggers are to be compensated,
or any fixed basis on which their claims are to be
valued, this has almost led to a dead-lock in the
gold production, and caused much litigation in
the High Court at Pretoria. The diggers decline
to enhance the value of any concessionaire’s property
by further exploring and opening it up,
and the concessionaires in but few cases have the
capital wherewith to compensate the diggers. As
European investors, however, are not so easily
influenced by a high-flown prospectus as formerly,
it is probable that before long the owners of the
farms bearing gold will see the propriety of again
throwing them open at a rental to diggers, and
thereby increasing their own revenue and that
of the country generally; for, with a large mining
population, both merchants and farmers find a
ready sale for their goods and produce; the natives
are taught to work, which is by far the most
civilising influence that can be brought to bear
upon them; and money will be circulated in a
country where the want of it has never been felt
more than at present.</p>

<p>There is not throughout the country what can
be called a mining town, the nearest approach to
one being Pilgrim’s Rest, about thirty-five miles
from the district of Lydenburg. This is on the
property of a London firm, who appear to be
sparing no expense, either in money or machinery,
to test their property thoroughly. The town is
situated in a most picturesque valley, reminding
one more of Switzerland than South Africa; and
the old fashion amongst Australians and Californians
of giving odd names to places is observable
here, in such names as Jerusalem Gully,
Tiger Creek, &amp;c. As usual, the Scotsman is
here in force, as may be naturally expected in
the most out-of-the-way place where there is a
chance of making money. Indeed, one of the
camps near Pilgrim’s Rest is named Mac-Mac,
after the number of Macs who formerly lived
there; one of them, who is buried near here,
being the unfortunate Mac whose strange story
was related in the account of St Kilda published
some years ago in this <i>Journal</i>.</p>

<p>The country, although very picturesque and
well watered in the valleys, is very rough to
travel over, and, without exception, has the worst
roads traversing it in South Africa. From Lydenburg
to Spitzkop, another mining camp, the road<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">{179}</span>
would make a London cab-driver’s hair stand on
end; and the trouble and danger of conveying
machinery along these roads by the cumbersome
bullock-wagon can only be understood by those
having experience of South Africa. From May
till October it is possible to obtain goods from
Delagoa Bay through the Portuguese port of
Lorenco Marques, the road being fairly good in
that direction; but during the remainder of the
year, the dreaded tsetse fly abounds on the road,
and the rivers are so swollen by the rains that
transport is impossible.</p>

<p>Those Companies intending to start work on
the gold-fields are endeavouring to arrange to
work their machinery by water-power, the cost
of fuel being very great here. Timber exists in
considerable quantities in the kloofs or valleys
of the mountains, but of a kind of little use for
fuel, and almost inaccessible. Coal is found near
Middleburg; but the cost of transport along these
roads would almost prevent its use, although the
distance does not exceed one hundred miles.
Water, apparently, will be the greatest difficulty
in regard to any scheme of comprehensive working
here, as for gold-working generally it is necessary
to obtain a good water-supply at a high
level, which is extremely difficult to obtain.
There are numerous streams in the valleys; but
their sources at a high level are very few, and
owing to the broken and diversified nature of
the ground, would cost large sums of money to
convey to any distance.</p>

<p>One very striking instance of perseverance in
the above way is that of a miner over sixty years
of age, who, unaided, has spent five years in
bringing a watercourse on towards his claims at
Spitzkop, and expects to take three years longer
to finish it. In spite of numerous difficulties in
the way of rocks and boulders, he has steadily
persevered, and has now got through the worst
of the work, and makes good progress, taking his
age into consideration. The length of this watercourse
will be about eleven miles when finished,
although the distance from point to point does not
exceed four.</p>

<p>The diggers are a wonderfully law-abiding community
as a whole; and it is astonishing to see
what a slender staff under the Boer government
is employed to maintain order, one solitary constable
at Pilgrim’s Rest being sufficient for twenty
miles round. Much trouble was caused from 1876
to 1879 through the war with the native chief
Secocoeni, and digging operations were almost suspended;
but his defeat by Sir Garnet Wolseley in
1879 left them free to work again until the end
of 1880, when the war between the Boers and the
British caused another cessation of work. All
these things, together with their present troubles
with the concessionaires, before alluded to, would
naturally lead one to expect impatience and turbulence
amongst a community many of whom
come from Australian and Californian diggings,
where the revolver is the readiest argument; but,
strange to say, it is not the case here.</p>

<p>Unless the working of the gold-fields brings
more money into the country, it is very difficult
to see what the future of the Transvaal will be.
The late war with the native chief Mapoch has
considerably impoverished the people; the exports
of the country are very trifling, and the low
state of the market at the Diamond Fields has
done away with a large source of income in the
sale of produce and coal. The revenue of the
country has steadily fallen since the retirement
of the British troops; the natives are either
unable or unwilling to pay taxes; and the Boers
themselves, with very few exceptions, wish the
British were back again. Pretoria and Potchefstroom,
the two principal towns, look almost
deserted, and have numerous empty buildings.
When we add to this the high price of living,
owing to the duties imposed on goods, &amp;c., the
lookout does not seem cheerful. It is not probable
that the British government will again resume
its sway here, even if invited unanimously by
the Boers, but it is possible that some system of
Union or Confederation will before long take
place amongst the different states of South Africa;
and should the railway be constructed from
Delagoa Bay, <i>viâ</i> Pretoria, to Kimberley, it is
certain that the country would benefit much by
the improved means of communication. These,
however, are prospects of the far future; and
until the gold-fields are further developed by the
present owners, and the government capable of
paying its way and seeing its course fairly before
it on a firm basis, it would be unwise for
intending investors to place too much faith on
the representations of promoters. Gold <i>is</i> in the
Transvaal, and in considerable quantities, but not
everywhere, and as yet comparatively little real
exploration has been carried on below the surface
to any depth. The crushing now commencing
at Pilgrim’s Rest and Ross Hill will be the first
real test as to the gold in the quartz, and it is
to be hoped will be satisfactory to those who
have had the courage to lead the way.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVIII.&mdash;THE SEALED LETTER.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span> drew his breath more freely. He experienced
that delightful sense of relief which
rewards one who has been long overstrained,
when the strain is relaxed before the stage of
exhaustion is reached. But such is the perversity
of human nature, that his gladness was
tinged with something resembling a degree of
disappointment. Certainly the tinge was so delicate
that he was not thoroughly aware of its real
character. To Madge the shade was revealed in
this way.</p>

<p>‘I wish the accident had been a little more
serious,’ he said.</p>

<p>She opened her eyes in astonishment. ‘What
a wicked wish,’ was her reproachful comment.</p>

<p>‘We have made such a fuss about my going,’
he went on, turning things over in his mind,
‘that we shall look ridiculous to everybody when
it becomes known that a stupid tumble off a horse
has stopped me.’</p>

<p>‘I think we should only be ridiculous if we
minded the foolish people who thought us so,’
she answered very wisely.</p>

<p>‘Ah, you never heard the story of the curate
who in a moment of enthusiasm declared his
intention of making a pilgrimage to Jerusalem.’</p>

<p>‘What about him?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">{180}</span></p>

<p>‘“What about him?” The poor beggar was so
worried by everybody he met afterwards asking
in surprise how he had managed to get back from
Jerusalem so soon&mdash;then why he hadn’t gone&mdash;when
he was going&mdash;and looking as if he had
perpetrated a fraud&mdash;that he was forced to make
the pilgrimage in order to escape being called
a humbug.’</p>

<p>‘But you are not a curate, and&mdash;I don’t think
you are a humbug, Philip,’ she said with a twinkle
of fun in her eyes.</p>

<p>‘I hope not,’ he rejoined, laughing. ‘But what
<i>can</i> have induced Uncle Shield to change all his
plans so suddenly?’</p>

<p>That question was a source of much marvel
to them both. During the afternoon, an idea
occurred to Madge, which seemed so extravagant,
that at first she only smiled at it, as one smiles
at the revelation of some pretty but absurd
dream.</p>

<p>This was the idea: that in some way this
sudden change of plans by Mr Shield was associated
with her and the memory of her mother.
She was nearer the truth than she imagined,
although the more she thought over it, the more
she was impressed by the possibility of the
surmise finding some foundation in the motives
which actuated Mr Shield’s present conduct.</p>

<p>She did not, however, think the surmise of
sufficient importance to speak about yet; but she
asked Aunt Hessy to tell Philip on the first
opportune occasion about her mother and his
uncle. Philip ought to know about it, whether
or not there was anything in her fanciful
idea.</p>

<p>Aunt Hessy, with a little smile of approval,
gave the promise, and, passing her hand affectionately
over the girl’s head, added: ‘Thou’lt be
a happy woman, dearie; and bring peace to sore
troubled breasts. There never was ill but good
lay behind it, if we would only seek and find
it. That’s an old saying; but there’s a deal of
comfort in most old sayings. Seems to me as
if they were the cries of folk that had proved
them through suffering.’</p>

<p>‘What did Mr Shield say in his letter to you,
aunt?’</p>

<p>The dame shook her head, and although still
smiling, looked as she felt, awkward.</p>

<p>‘I am not to tell thee&mdash;anyway, not now.
By-and-by, when I come to understand it myself,
I will tell thee; but do not thou ask again until
I speak. It will be best.’</p>

<p>And Madge knew that whatever Aunt Hessy
chose to do&mdash;whether to speak or be silent&mdash;would
be best. So she said simply: ‘Very well,
aunt.’</p>

<p>‘I am going into the oak room to wrestle with
the spirit, as my father used to say when he
wanted to be left quite by himself. I want to
be quite by myself till I get the right end of this
riddle. I have been trying it two or three times
since you went out, but the answer has not come
yet. I am to try again. Be not you afraid,
though I do not come out till tea-time.’</p>

<p>She spoke as if amused at herself; but when
she had closed the door of the oak room and
seated herself in a big armchair beside one of
the gaunt windows, the smile faded from her
kindly face, and her expression became one of
mingled sadness and perplexity.</p>

<p>But everything Dame Crawshay had to do
was done sedately&mdash;with that perfect composure
which can be obtained only by a mind at rest
with itself and innocent of all evil intention.
She put on her spectacles, and quietly took from
her pocket the two letters she had received from
Mr Shield. One was open, and she had studied
it many times that day, for it presented the
riddle she had not yet been able to solve: the
other, which had been inclosed in the first, was
still unopened.</p>

<p>She settled herself down to make one more
effort to find the right thing to do.</p>

<p>‘Dear Friend,’ said the open letter, ‘in telling
me that I have still a kindly place in your
memory, you have given me a pleasure which I
am glad to have lived long enough to experience.
Thank you. And I ask you to take this “Thank
you” in its full sense of respect and gratitude.</p>

<p>‘I knew that’&mdash;here there was a word scored
out, but the dame deciphered it to be ‘Lucy’—‘<i>she</i>
had left a daughter under your care. I have
thought of her&mdash;very often thought of her; and
wished that it might be in my power to serve
her as I would have served her mother, had I
known of her misfortunes in time. But whenever
I thought of writing to you about her, my pen
was stopped by the same strange stupor&mdash;paralysis
or whatever it may be that affects my brains
whenever certain memories are stirred&mdash;the same
which rendered me dumb and incapable of
listening to you, when you might have given me
explanations that would no doubt have made my
suffering less. I do not ask for explanations
now; perhaps it would be best to give me none.
I am sure it would be best; and yet I have a
longing to know anything you may have to tell
me about Lucy. Time has taken the sting from
memory: there is no bitterness in my thought
of her&mdash;I do not think there ever was any bitterness
in my thoughts about her. Looking back,
I only see the bright days when we were so
happy together, dreaming of our future. Then
there is the black day when you told me she
was married. Somebody died that day&mdash;my
better self, I always think. Since then, I seem
to have been toiling through a long tunnel, so
numbed with cold and sunk in darkness that I
have felt nothing and seen nothing.</p>

<p>‘But the information contained in your note
about the intended marriage of Lucy’s child to
Philip Hadleigh has brought me back into the
daylight. The change was so sudden, that for
a little while my eyes were dazzled and my mind
confused. I see clearly now. Here is my opportunity
to serve Lucy. There can be nothing you
can tell me which can affect my craving to serve
her; and I can only do it by guarding her
daughter. I proceed to England by the next
steamer which leaves the nearest port.</p>

<p>‘I am aware that you will find it difficult to
understand me from what I have written here.
I have tried to make my purpose plain to you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">{181}</span>
in the packet which is inclosed with this; but
what is put down there is for the present intended
only for you. Before you break the seal, I ask
you, in Lucy’s name, to keep my confidence from
your niece, and even from your husband, until
we meet. Should this be asking too much, I
beseech you to put the packet into the fire without
opening it. Let me assure you at once that
in withholding my purpose for a time from others,
you will in nowise harm&mdash;or even run the risk of
harming the living or the dead, whilst you may
be able to assist me greatly in the service I wish
to do for your sister’s child.</p>

<p>‘Decide as you will: I trust you shall be
satisfied that the grounds for your decision are
as sufficient as mine are for the course I have
adopted.’</p>

<p>Here was the question she found it so difficult
to answer: could she accept this trust? It was
contrary to all her notions of right that she should
have any thought which she might not communicate
to her husband. She had never had a secret;
her life had run so smoothly that there had been
no occasion for one. She was grateful for having
been spared the temptations to falsehood, which
a secret, however trifling in itself, entails. But
she took no special credit to herself on this
account. Indeed, the good woman found it hard
to understand why there should be any mysteries
in the conduct of people at all. The straightforward
course appeared to her so much easier
to travel than the crooked ways which some choose
or fall into unawares, that she wondered why,
on purely selfish grounds, they should continue
in them, when the way out was so simple.</p>

<p>At this moment her theory was put to a severe
test. She was asked to keep a secret, but it was
not her own or of her seeking. Then she should
refuse to accept the trust. On the other hand,
she was assured by one in whose honesty she had
every reason to place implicit faith, that the secret
meant no harm to any one&mdash;that she was only
required to keep it for a time, and that by so
doing she would aid him in carrying into effect
his design for the welfare of Madge.</p>

<p>She took a practical view of the mode in which
he proposed to benefit the child of the woman
he had loved long ago. He was rich, he was
childless: of course his purpose must be to make
her his heiress. Then why should he make such
a mystery of such a generous act? She had heard
of people who took the drollest possible way of
bequeathing their fortunes. Maybe it amused
them: maybe they were a little wrong in the
head, and were therefore to be pitied. Why,
then, should she not humour him, by letting him
have his own way so long as it was harmless,
as she would do with any person whose eccentricity
could not be agreeably dealt with otherwise?
This was coming nearer to a settlement of her
doubts.</p>

<p>Now she could either burn the sealed letter,
or send it to him at his lawyer’s, whose address
he gave her for further communications. But
the argument was in favour of opening it; and
what lingering hesitation she might have on the
subject was decided by that strain of curiosity
which the best of women have inherited.</p>

<p>She deliberately cut the envelope with her
scissors and unfolded the paper on her lap. The
contents were somewhat of the nature she expected;
but the way in which he purposed benefiting
Madge was different from anything she could
have guessed.</p>

<p>‘Although events which in the first hours of
their occurrence appeared to be too hard for me
to live through have become in time only sad
memories, flitting at intervals across my mind
without causing pain or interfering with my
ordinary ways, your letter has brought me so
close to the old times, that I seem to be living in
them again. The old interests&mdash;the old passions
are as strong upon me at this moment as they
were when I still possessed the greatest of all
fortunes&mdash;Youth and Hope.</p>

<p>‘Even when I knew that <i>she</i> was lost to me,
there remained the prospect that some day she
might need my help, and I should find consolation
in giving it. Her death took that comfort
from me, and I settled down to the dull business
of living without a purpose. Luck, not labour,
brought me <i>money</i>&mdash;that is why I am indifferent
to it. This was how it came.</p>

<p>‘You remember the old hawthorn tree in your
father’s garden, where so many glad hours were
spent with Lucy? Well, on a green patch of
this land which I was lazily farming here was
an old hawthorn tree, and associating it with the
one which had such deep root in my memory,
it became my favourite resting-place. I made
a seat beneath it as like the old one as possible,
and there I used to sit reading or thinking of
the dead man who was my former self. Under
this tree I found a diamond: it was the first of
many. But you have read about the diamond
fields&mdash;and now you know the source of my
wealth.</p>

<p>‘My intention has been from the first that
Lucy’s daughter should benefit by my luck. I
could not feel, and you could not expect me to
feel, much active interest in her childhood, knowing
that she was under your protection, and therefore
well cared for. Your information that she
is engaged to marry Philip Hadleigh has roused
me from a long sleep. I have formed a good
opinion of the young man from his letters. I
purposed having him here with me for a year
or so, in order to judge of his character before
deciding in what manner I should best fulfil the
promise given to my sister, to do what I could
for him in the future. The fact that you and
your husband regard him with so much favour
as to give your niece to him, would be in the
case of another a sufficient guarantee that he is
worthy of all trust.</p>

<p>‘<i>But he is Lloyd Hadleigh’s son.</i></p>

<p>‘What that means to me, I do not care to
explain, and it is unnecessary to do so. It is
sufficient to tell you that it compels me to make
him <i>prove</i> that he is worthy of trust&mdash;above all,
that he is worthy of Madge Heathcote.</p>

<p>‘I intended to judge of him by observing his
ways during his stay with me. Now I intend to
put him to the severest test of human nature&mdash;the
test of what is called Good Fortune.</p>

<p>‘You love your niece. You cannot trust the
man if you object to let him prove his worth.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Austin Shield.</span>’
</p>


<h3>CHAPTER XIX.&mdash;THE FIRST INTERVIEW.</h3>

<p>A few days had passed when Philip startled
little Dr Joy with the information that he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">{182}</span>
had walked two miles and felt equal to two
more.</p>

<p>‘But you must not try it, though,’ said the
doctor quickly; ‘you are a strong fellow, but
you must not be in too great a hurry to prove it.
We must be economical of our strength, you know,
as well as of everything else. You are getting
on nicely&mdash;very nicely and with wonderful
rapidity. Don’t spoil it all by too much eagerness.’</p>

<p>‘Don’t be afraid&mdash;I’ll take care.’</p>

<p>The afternoon post brought him a note from
Mr Shield, announcing his arrival at the
<i>Langham Hotel</i>, and inquiring if he felt strong
enough to call there next day at eleven.</p>

<p>‘I am quite strong enough to be with you at
the time mentioned,’ was Philip’s prompt reply;
and he kept the engagement punctually.</p>

<p>Being expected, he was conducted immediately
to the sitting-room of one of the finest suites of
apartments on the first floor. Evidently Mr
Shield had an idea of taking advantage of all
the comforts of the old country, to make up for
whatever inconveniences he had submitted to in
his colonial life.</p>

<p>Standing at one of the windows was a big
brawny man, dressed in dark-brown tweed. He
turned as Philip entered, and showed a face
covered with thick, shaggy hair, which had been
black, but was now plentifully streaked with
silver. Of his features, only the eyes and nose
were distinguishable, for the shaggy hair fell over
his brow, too, in defiance of combs and brushes.</p>

<p>Philip’s idea of Mr Shield’s appearance had
been vague enough; but somehow this man was
so unlike every preconceived notion of him, that
he would have fancied there was a mistake, had
not all doubt been at once removed by the
greeting he received.</p>

<p>‘How do you do, Philip? Glad to see you.’</p>

<p>He held out a big horny hand, which betokened
a long friendship with pickaxe and spade. His
manner was somewhat rough, but it was frank
and good-natured. Still it was unlike the manner
of one who had received some education and had
been accustomed to move in ordinary society.
All this, however, Philip quickly accounted for
by recalling the fact, that Mr Shield had been
living so many years on the outskirts of civilisation,
that he must have forgotten much, and
unconsciously adopted some of the characteristics
of his uncouth associates.</p>

<p>‘I am glad to see you at last, sir,’ he said,
grasping the extended hand cordially.</p>

<p>‘That’s right. I like a man who can give you
a grip when he does shake hands. If he can’t,
he ought to leave it alone. I don’t bother much
with hand-shaking. A nod’s as good in our part.
But coming so far, you see—— Oh, all right’ (the
last phrase was like a private exclamation, as he
suddenly remembered something).... ‘Sit down.
Have anything?’</p>

<p>‘No; thank you.’</p>

<p>‘Ah, right, right. Under orders, I suppose.
Forgot your accident. How’s the ribs?’</p>

<p>‘Pretty well, I am happy to say,’ answered
Philip, smiling at the droll, gruff, abrupt style of
his uncle, and appreciating the kindliness which
was clearly visible through it. ‘The doctors tell
me I shall never know that the accident happened.’</p>

<p>‘That’s good. Now you know what we are
not to speak about, and what we are to speak
about is yourself.’</p>

<p>‘That is generally an agreeable subject.’</p>

<p>‘Should be always to a youngster like you.
Now, I want to start you in life. That was my
promise, and I am able to keep it. What is your
notion of a start?’</p>

<p>‘I have not decided yet. The result of my
journey to you was to settle what was to follow.
As that journey is now unnecessary, I think of
entering for the bar or medicine.’</p>

<p>‘Stuff. Too many lawyers and doctors already.
You keep in mind who it was wished you to
come to me?... You needn’t speak.&mdash;I see you
do. Then will you obey her, and become my
partner?’</p>

<p>‘Your partner!’ ejaculated Philip, astounded
by the abruptness of this extraordinary proposal.</p>

<p>‘Don’t you like the notion? Most young fellows
would snap at it.’</p>

<p>‘I am aware of that, Mr Shield; but I have no
capital except what my fa’——</p>

<p>‘That’s all right. You go to Hawkins and
Jackson. They will satisfy you that you have
plenty of capital, and will explain to you that
there is a chance for you to become one of the
biggest men in London&mdash;M.P.&mdash;Lord Mayor&mdash;anything
you like, if you only enter into partnership
with me.’</p>

<p>‘I am a little bewildered, sir, and would like
to understand exactly’——</p>

<p>‘Hawkins is waiting for you,’ said Mr Shield,
looking at his watch; ‘he will make everything
plain to you before you leave him. He has full
orders&mdash;instructions, that is to say. I have somebody
else to see now. You’ll write and tell me
how you take to the plan, and I’ll let you know
when we are to meet again.’</p>

<p>‘I ought to thank you; but’——</p>

<p>‘Don’t bother about that&mdash;time enough for
it&mdash;time enough. Good-bye.’</p>

<p>The interview was over. Philip was metaphorically
hustled out of the room by the brusque,
good-natured relative he had just found. He felt
confused and bewildered as he walked slowly
down Regent Street, trying to realise the meaning
of all the suggestions which had been made to
him. There was something humorous, too, in
having a fortune thrust upon him in this singular
fashion. For he knew that to become the partner
of Austin Shield was equivalent to inheriting a
large fortune.</p>

<p>In their correspondence of course, Mr Shield
had told him that he meant to ‘see what could
be done for him;’ but he had added that everything
would depend upon how they got on
together, after they had lived for a time under
the same roof. Now everything was given to
him when they had been only a few minutes
together&mdash;indeed had been given before they met
at all, for all arrangements in reference to the
partnership had been already made, and only
awaited his acceptance.</p>

<p>‘He is an odder fish in person than he has
shown himself in his letters,’ thought Philip.
‘We’ll see what Hawkins says.’</p>

<p>He took a cab, and as he was driving to the
office of the solicitors, his thoughts cleared. There<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">{183}</span>
was no doubt that the prospect so freely offered
him was a brilliant one; but there was a cloud
upon it. How would his father regard this
arrangement?</p>

SCHOOL.</h2>
</div>
<p class="ph3">GORDON’S COLLEGE, ABERDEEN.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Our</span> Minister for Education, Mr Mundella, in a
recent visit to Glasgow and Edinburgh, delivered
a series of speeches remarkable not only for the
interesting accounts he gave of the progress of
elementary education under the national system
established by the Education Acts, but for their
strong advocacy of the necessity of providing still
higher and more useful education by means of
secondary and technical schools. He indicated
that this might in some measure be attained by
a judicious reform of existing educational endowments,
and he instanced one case of such reorganisation,
which he held up as a model worthy of
imitation. The case referred to was that of the
institution now known as Robert Gordon’s College,
Aberdeen. The ‘reform’ achieved by this institution
has been so thorough and so successful,
and has been conducted so much in the direction
indicated by Mr Mundella, that some details
of its nature and the work now being accomplished
by its agency may prove interesting in
themselves, and advantageous as furnishing an
illustration of how our general educational system
may be improved and perfected.</p>

<p>The institution was founded by a Robert Gordon,
who had been at one time a merchant in Danzig,
but ultimately settled in Aberdeen, where he died
in 1731. He bequeathed all his property to
certain trustees, for the building of a hospital,
and for the maintenance and education of young
boys whose parents were poor and indigent, and
not able to maintain them at school or put them
to trades and employments. Owing to the civil
disorders of the time, the hospital was not opened
till 1750. The trust funds, together with the
value and revenue of a separate estate bequeathed
in 1816 by a Mr Alexander Simpson of Collyhill,
now amount to an annual revenue of over eight
thousand pounds. There were latterly two hundred
boys in the hospital, forty of these being
nominated by the Collyhill trustees. The period
of residence was five years; the education imparted
was a fairly good, sound, elementary
one, with a little instruction in mathematics
and chemistry, and a smattering of Latin and
French. The bulk of the boys drifted into mercantile
pursuits.</p>

<p>The passing of the Educational Endowments
Act of 1878 opened up for the institution a new
and wider sphere of usefulness. In June 1881,
the governing body obtained a Provisional Order
under the Act, greatly altering the constitution
and objects of the original trust, and constituting
the hospital a College, in which the chief subjects
of study shall be English Language and Literature,
History and Geography, Modern Languages,
Mathematics, and the Elements of Physical and
Natural Science. The number of foundationers
was reduced to one hundred and twenty, and
the ‘hospital’ system was almost entirely abolished.
The hospital buildings were converted
into a day school; the standard of education was
raised; evening classes were established; and provision
was made for the amalgamation with the
College of any mechanics’ institute, scientific or
technical school, or other educational institution.</p>

<p>The College, therefore, as now constituted consists
of a day school and an evening school. It
is not necessary for our purposes to detail the work
of the day school in the junior department; but
in the senior, the work branches off into three
divisions, the studies being specialised with a
regard to the line of work the boys intend pursuing
on leaving school. In the Commercial School
prominent attention is given to modern languages
(French and German), mathematics, arithmetic,
book-keeping, and letter and précis writing, the
studies in science being also continued. In the
Trade and Engineering School the studies carried
forward are English and one foreign language
(French or German); but most of the time is
devoted to mathematics, experimental science, and
drawing; applied science and technical drawing
being the features of the second year. The teaching
in both years is accompanied by systematic
instruction in the workshop (in wood and iron);
while for intending young engineers there is a
special course in steam and the steam-engine; and
for those aiming at the building trades, a special
course in building construction and drawing.
The workshop, which is under the superintendence
of a practical man, is large and well
equipped. It has thirteen benches and a lathe,
and a forge and three vice-benches; and a proposal
is about to be submitted to the governing
body for the further development of this practical
department by providing a steam-engine and
other appliances. The third division of the school&mdash;the
Classical&mdash;is for boys intending to proceed
to the university.</p>

<p>At the present time, there are five hundred
and eighty day scholars, one hundred and twenty
of whom are foundationers. Ninety day scholars
are receiving instruction in the workshop in
relays of fifteen at a time, one hour being devoted
to the workshop, and four hours to ordinary
teaching. The school-hours are five per day,
and most of the school-work is done in that time,
the pupils, though not altogether exempt from
home-work, not being oppressed by it. Plenty
of time is thus given for exercise and enjoyment;
and there is no complaint of ‘over-pressure,’ either
on the part of teachers or taught.</p>

<p>The evening school, which is open to adults,
and to girls as well as to boys, is divided into
two sections. There is a General and Commercial
section, in which instruction is given in such
subjects as English, arithmetic, French, German,
theory of music, phonography, and political economy.
Then there is a Science and Technology
section, having classes for practical plane and solid
geometry, machine and building construction
and drawing, applied mechanics and steam, metal
working tools, carpentry and joinery, magnetism
and electricity, electrical engineering, inorganic
chemistry, and botany. To the Physics and
Chemistry lecture-rooms are attached a large
apparatus-room and commodious laboratories; and
the means and appliances are enlarged from time
to time, one hundred pounds being devoted this
year to the purchase of scientific apparatus and
chemicals. In the Applied Mechanics class, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">{184}</span>
strength of materials and the strains in structures
are investigated experimentally; while the class
meets occasionally on Saturday afternoons for
experiments in practical mechanics in the laboratory,
or to study the actual applications of
mechanics in some of the engineering works in the
town.</p>

<p>The classes in the Science section are specially
adapted for students qualifying for the examinations
of the Science and Art Department and of
the Society of Arts, and for the City and Guilds
of London examinations in Technology; and the
College&mdash;under the able direction of the head-master,
the Rev. Alexander Ogilvie, LL.D.&mdash;is
now beginning to take a high position in connection
with these examinations. Dr Ogilvie first
instituted Science and Art classes in Gordon’s
Hospital in 1875, not only for boys in the hospital,
but also for those who had completed their
education there and were serving apprenticeships
in Aberdeen. The beginnings were small, classes
for magnetism and electricity and physical geography
being first started. In course of time, however,
botany was added, followed by mathematics,
theoretical mechanics, and inorganic chemistry;
and soon half-a-dozen classes were in full swing,
yielding by-and-by very satisfactory results, all
the more satisfactory as teaching in these special
subjects was given out of school-hours, or, as the
inspector reported, ‘Science has taken its place in
the institution, and has displaced nothing.’</p>

<p>The reorganisation of the College, which came
into practical operation in August 1881, gave a
new impetus to the evening classes and the science
teaching. During session 1881-82, two hundred
and four scholars attended the evening classes, of
whom one hundred and seventy-one presented
themselves at the examinations of the Science and
Art Department. Of these, sixty-nine gained
eighty-eight Queen’s prizes, value twenty-eight
pounds ten shillings, and first-class certificates;
eighty-seven gained second-class certificates; and
fifteen failed. The total Department (government)
grants that fell to the teachers amounted
to three hundred and forty-six pounds ten
shillings. In session 1882-83, the number of
tickets issued for the evening classes was&mdash;For
General and Commercial classes, six hundred
and eighty-two; for Science classes, five hundred
and eighty-seven: total, twelve hundred and
sixty-nine. Of this number, three hundred
and eighty-one individual students attended the
Science classes, of whom two hundred and thirty-five
were present at the examinations. Ninety
of these gained one hundred and twenty-two
Queen’s prizes, of the value of thirty-nine pounds
five shillings, with first-class certificates; one hundred
and four gained second-class certificates; and
forty-one failed. The grants earned from the
Department amounted to three hundred and
sixty-five pounds. In the Society of Arts’ examinations,
sixty-nine candidates were examined&mdash;the
largest number from any institution, except the
Birmingham and Midland Institute&mdash;and fifty-three
passed, four gaining first-class certificates,
and twenty second-class certificates. In the City
and Guilds’ examination, the number presented
in technology&mdash;metal working tools&mdash;was eight,
of whom two gained first-class honours, five stood
first-class in the ordinary grade, and one second-class.
One student so distinguished himself, being
second in the examination of all the candidates in
the United Kingdom, that he was awarded a prize
of three pounds and a bronze medal.</p>

<p>Within the past year, the Science teaching
in the College has been largely developed by a
provisional amalgamation with the Aberdeen
Mechanics’ Institution, in connection with which
there has been for many years a School of Art
and Science classes. The Science classes and the
scientific apparatus of the Mechanics’ Institution
have been transferred to the College, which has
become thereby the Science school for the city.
The amalgamation&mdash;almost certain to be permanently
ratified&mdash;coupled with the more complete
and systematic instruction in Gordon’s College,
promises to be fruitful of good results, which may,
indeed, be already anticipated, for no fewer than
fifteen hundred and forty-seven students have
enrolled themselves in the various evening classes
for the current session.</p>

<p>The value of the work which the College is
accomplishing can hardly be over-estimated. The
objects of the institution, as now recast, are&mdash;in
addition to the education of foundationers&mdash;to
afford a good elementary education at fees
so small as to make it within the reach
of the sons of working-men even; to help
its own scholars, and boys leaving Board Schools,
to a knowledge of subjects not otherwise readily
attainable; and to furnish to the apprentice
and the artisan instruction in science and technology
of a higher grade. The College, in
short, aims at being a complete and efficient
secondary school, and really forms for the city
of Aberdeen the much-desiderated link between
elementary and university education&mdash;a link
that will be more apparent and more serviceable
when the universities come to be reformed,
and when more attention will likely be paid
to scientific than to classical studies. Even
as things are, a number of the scholars have
already found their way to the university, and
have been successful in gaining bursaries and
other honours; and two of them&mdash;educated partly
in the Hospital and partly in the College&mdash;have
recently passed the competitions for the Indian
Civil Service without the preliminary ‘coaching’
in London, generally regarded as essential. One
of the two is now in receipt of one hundred
and fifty pounds a year during his two years
of probation, after which he will become one
of Her Majesty’s civil servants in India. The
Commercial School provides an education well
suited for young men who intend engaging in
the various occupations and industries of the
town and district; while in the evening classes
they have every opportunity of continuing their
studies as their inclinations or their pursuits
dictate.</p>

<p>But the most important work of the College
is the scientific and technical education it imparts.
The object here is to furnish in the day school
such an elementary practical knowledge as will
prepare boys to become intelligent apprentices;
in the evening school, on the other hand, to
furnish higher theoretical instruction to boys and
men really at work. The workshop is for the
use of day scholars only; the evening pupils
find their practical training in their daily work,
and come to the College to learn the theory.
The day school aims at teaching the pupils on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">{185}</span>
the technical side the elements of the constructive
arts and the character of materials, concurrently
with thorough education in the interpretation
of working drawings. It is explicitly intimated
that ‘it is by no means intended that a boy
should learn his trade in the College, but only
that he should lay the foundation of the scientific
and technical knowledge which has become an
essential concomitant of trade experience and
manual dexterity.’ This distinction has to be
borne in mind; for Gordon’s College is not an
‘apprenticeship school,’ such, for instance, as the
one maintained by the Paris municipality in the
Boulevard de la Villette, which turns out its
pupils, at the end of a three years’ course, as
having finished their apprenticeship, and as being
ready for employment as journeymen, or even
as foremen. The fault of this system of training
artisans is that it underrates what is to be
learned in the ordinary workshop; and instead
of having recourse to it, the governing body of
Gordon’s College set to work on the lines just
mentioned.</p>

<p>It is obviously impossible as yet to discern the
effect which this improved technical education
will have upon the arts and industries of the
town; but some estimate of the actual work accomplished
may be formed from the following account
of models exhibited at the last distribution of
prizes, which we take from a local paper:</p>

<p>‘A large number of drawings by the pupils
attracted much attention, and a special feature was
an exhibition of models executed in the workshop
in the course of the year. These models were the
work of the pupils, and an examination showed
that they were highly finished, and that in every
instance the greatest care had been taken, down
even to the most minute detail. The models
were large in number, and diverse in character.
One was a very fine sample of a suspension
bridge, measuring twelve feet in length,
and weighted so as to show the strain it was
capable of sustaining. There was also what is
known as a roof-truss, an arrangement for finding
what, under given circumstances, would be the
strain put upon the rafters and the rods. Then
there was a model crane adjusted for a precisely
similar purpose, and very neatly finished apparatus
for experimenting with the inclined plane, the
lever, and friction coil, &amp;c. A number of
well-finished specimens of electrical apparatus
formed part of the exhibits, including one or two
very good galvanometers and a small electrical
engine. In woodwork the variety was large. A
walking-stick was shown which on occasion could
be transformed into a tripod stand for surveying.
There were also models of the various jointings
employed in woodwork, and several excellent
specimens of work both in wood and iron.
Possibly the most striking feature of the whole
display was a sectional model of a steam-engine,
which measured some thirteen feet in
length and showed all the working parts. It
was also provided with means of adjustment to
find by experiment the effect of varying the
dimensions of the various parts. The entire
model was coloured in accordance with the
ordinary rule in engineering works. Among the
ordinary articles shown were a grindstone frame,
a vice-bench, and a number of smithy tools. It
may be mentioned that the whole of the work in
connection with the models was not only executed
by the boys themselves, but that in every case
they had also prepared the working drawings.’</p>

<p>It is not too much to infer that elementary
instruction which produces such results as these
will prove an important factor in the work of
after-life; and we may safely conclude that the
College is not unlikely to realise a large measure
of the success which it deserves, besides serving
as an example to other scholastic and commercial
communities.</p>

<h3 title="CONCLUSION.">IN FOUR CHAPTERS.&mdash;CONCLUSION.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Never</span> before had Ben from mental excitement
passed a sleepless night; his seasoned, iron nerves
had borne him through a multitude of perils&mdash;from
hostile Indians, from white enemies; from
the bear, the wolf, the snake; from fire and flood;
and when the time had come for him to sleep,
he slept soundly; when his rough meals were
prepared, he ate well. But it was different now.
The recollection of the face which confronted his
own at the restaurant, haunted him, broke his
sleep into fitful dozing, and filled these unrefreshing
snatches with terrible dreams. Yet, when the
bright morning came, he persuaded himself that
he must have been mistaken&mdash;that he had exaggerated
some chance resemblance into the identity
of his dead partner.</p>

<p>Ben’s reflections touched upon what was growing
into another dreadful form of mental excitement.
He began to fear that he had not seen
the man at all, that it was merely a delusion,
a vision of the brain. And that such a delusion
should take the form of Rube Steele was not surprising,
bearing in mind the fact, which was never
long absent from his thoughts, that he had given
this man a blow which, if it had not, as he formerly
supposed, caused the man’s death, must
have very nearly done so. No doubt the blow
was struck in self-defence; but even murder in
self-defence is not a thing which a man can in
his calmer moments recall without some sense of
remorse.</p>

<p>He was early at the hotel, and taking his regular
seat, waited with a nervous anxiety, such as he
had rarely experienced before, the appearance of
the stranger. He had not long to wait. Almost
as soon as he was seated, a figure entered the
saloon which there was no mistaking, and all
Ben’s consolatory theories as to a casual resemblance
deceiving him, fled on the instant. The
stoop of the long body and neck, the crafty glance
the man threw around on entering, his very step&mdash;these
were all Rube Steele’s; and to the dismay
of Ben, the new-comer evidently glanced round
the saloon in search of <i>him</i>, for the moment he
saw him, his face lighted up with a smile, and
he came to the table.</p>

<p>‘Glad to see you again!’ said he, extending
a hand which a horrible fascination compelled
Ben to seize and shake; but the familiarity of
the touch was more horrible still. He felt&mdash;he
knew for a certainty, he had touched that hand
a thousand times.</p>

<p>‘I thought mebbe you made this your regular
dining location,’ continued the other; ‘and I have
kinder taken a fancy to you.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">{186}</span></p>

<p>‘In-deed!’ gasped Ben, wondering as to what
would come next.</p>

<p>‘Yes, I have; that is so,’ replied the stranger.
‘I reckon you have not been located in this city
very long?’</p>

<p>‘Not very long,’ said Ben, who had not once
removed his eyes from the other’s face. ‘I came
from the West&mdash;from the mining country.’</p>

<p>‘Possible!’ ejaculated the stranger. ‘Wal,
now, I take a great interest in the mining
countries, and like to hear tell of them. Were
you from Californy, or Nevady, or’——</p>

<p>‘From Colorado,’ gasped Ben, who almost
began to fancy that he was losing his senses, so
certain was he that the man was Rube, and yet
so inconsistent with this belief was the whole of
his conversation, especially his liking for Ben,
and his anxiety to hear of the mines.</p>

<p>When they separated, it was with another
shake of the hand, and a strongly expressed hope
on the part of the stranger that they might meet
again the next day. ‘Either the critter is a
ghost,’ thought Ben&mdash;‘and in that case there <i>are</i>
ghosts&mdash;or I am going crazy; or he is Rube
Steele; and I know that is impossible. I won’t
go to this hotel any more; and soon as we get
married, Ruth and I will live out of the city,
and that is a comfort.’</p>

<p>Fortified by this reflection, he was able to bear
up somewhat better on this day, and to accept
Mr Showle’s invitation with a calmer mind. He
arrived early at the merchant’s house. Ruth
came in soon afterwards, and he was pleased to
see that she, too, looked more cheerful. Ruth
had relieved her mind, as she confessed to Ben,
by telling him her trouble; and now he knew it,
she felt that the worst was over. It was to avoid
her half-brother, she owned, that she had wished
Ben to live so far from town, and as he had
now really arrived, he was glad they had agreed
upon this precaution.</p>

<p>They were conversing cheerfully enough, when
a knock was heard at the outer door, and Mr
Showle, rising, exclaimed: ‘There is Morede! I
know his knock. Indeed, he takes care we shall
hear him.&mdash;I am sure you will like him, Creelock,
and he is very anxious to see you.&mdash;Ah! Mr
Morede! you are punctual, then! Come in, and
let me introduce you to our friend Creelock.’
Saying this, he shook hands with the new arrival,
and led him to where Ben was standing.</p>

<p>‘I think,’ said Mr Morede, as he took Ben’s
hand with a smile, ‘I am not entirely a stranger
to Mr Creelock. I have had the pleasure of
dining with him more than once at the <i>Ocean
House</i>.’</p>

<p>Yes, he had; of course he had. Of course he
was not a stranger to Ben&mdash;far from it, and Ben
knew it well; for here was his mysterious
companion at dinner, the new partner in Showle
and Bynnes, and Ruth’s half-brother, all turning
out to be not only one and the same person, but
were also each and every one Rube Steele, his
treacherous partner, whom he had left for dead in
Colorado! And why did he not recognise Ben,
as Ben had recognised him? Of all the strange
features in this bewildering matter, this was the
strangest.</p>

<p>Ben shook hands, as an automaton might have
done, and spoke as though in a trance; the odd
tone and character of his replies, and his fixed
stare, evidently attracting the notice of Ruth and
Mr Showle.</p>

<p>‘Come, Creelock!’ cried the latter presently;
‘you are not yourself to-night. Where are your
mining stories and your prairie adventures? I
have been praising you all the time to our friend
Morede here, as a sort of live volume of entertainment
on these matters, and you are not saying
a word about them.’</p>

<p>‘Mr Showle is entirely right; he is so,’ said
Morede; ‘and I reckon I shall be quite pleased
to sit around and hear somethin’ about the
western mines. I always do like to hear tell of
them.’</p>

<p>‘Do you?’ exclaimed Ben, rousing himself in
a species of desperation, and resolving to bring
this horrible torture to a finish. ‘Shall I tell
you an adventure of my own?’</p>

<p>‘Just so,’ returned Morede, with a pleased
smile. ‘I should like it above all things.’</p>

<p>‘Then,’ said Ben&mdash;and his answering smile
was of a somewhat grimmer character, in spite
of himself, than Morede’s had been&mdash;‘then I
will tell you how my pardner at the mines introduced
a stranger, who robbed me of fifteen hundred
dollars. This stranger came, I should tell
you, with information about Indians, on the war-path
who were likely to be around our camp.
But it was an arranged plot. He was a mean
cuss, this stranger; he or his friends robbed the
placers and broke the stamp-mill. It was either
him or my pardner that shot at me from a gully;
and the bullet went through my hat and cut
away some of my hair. That was not the only
time my pardner got his desperadoes to shoot at
me; so I will tell you about <i>him</i>.’</p>

<p>Thereupon, stimulated by the desperate impulse
we have alluded to, Ben proceeded to relate a
part of the plot which had been devised for his
ruin by his crafty partner; the incidents attendant
on which greatly excited, and sometimes almost
appalled his hearers, none among whom listened
with more palpable interest than did Mr
Morede. Ben told all, up to the action of the
Vigilantes, but could not bring himself to speak
of the final scene at the pool; there was something
too horrible in the idea of describing <i>that</i>
to his listeners. When Ben had finished, which
he did by saying, ‘What do you think of that,
Mr Morede?’ and looking his new partner straight
in the face, the latter exclaimed, in what seemed
the most genuine manner possible: ‘First-rate,
Mr Creelock! I admire you. I see you have the
real grit; and I wish I had been there to help
you in such a fix. But, to my thinking, your
partner was the worse of the two.’</p>

<p>‘He was,’ said Ben drily.</p>

<p>‘And he ought to have had his reward,’ continued
Morede.</p>

<p>‘He had it,’ said Ben, with increased dryness.</p>

<p>‘Good! Good!’ cried Morede; and other comments
being made, the conversation became
general.</p>

<p>Morede bore his part all through the evening
without a single allusion which could induce Ben
to suppose he had the slightest remembrance of
him, or had ever before heard a syllable relating
to the dangerous stranger or the robberies. When
they parted for the night, too, he was particularly
demonstrative in his friendliness to Creelock,
making quite a ‘smart oration,’ as Mr Showle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">{187}</span>
afterwards remarked, on the agreeable evening
he had passed, and the pleasure it would give
him to be associated in business, and as he hoped,
in still closer relationship with a man whom he
admired and liked so much at first sight as he
did Mr Creelock. Ben went home after this
speech in doubt as to whether it was himself or
every one around him that was going mad.</p>

<p>Day after day passed, and the new partners in
the firm met frequently, with no diminution in
the friendship which Mr Morede had from the
first professed for Ben. They did not meet at
the hotel, however; the strain on Ben’s nerves
was bad enough when they met as part of a group.
A <i>tête-à-tête</i> was more than he could stand with
a man whom he believed to have killed, but
who was now walking about as unconcernedly
as though he had never been stretched by the
side of that Colorado pool.</p>

<p>So confounded had Ben been by the apparition,
that he had never thought of asking the Christian
name of Mr Morede, and it came upon him
as a new shock when he received a note from
the warehouse on some business matters signed
‘Reuben Morede,’ while he could have sworn
to the handwriting in a court of justice. This
did not increase his certainty, for it could admit
of no increase; he <i>was</i> certain, and could not go
beyond that; but it seemed to make the position
more dreadful and complicated. Now and then,
too, he would find, if he turned quickly round,
Mr Morede gazing fixedly upon him&mdash;an earnest
gaze, as though he were striving to recall something
to his memory; and this was not agreeable
to Creelock.</p>

<p>He asked Ruth, as guardedly as possible, about
her brother’s past career; but she knew nothing
of it since he had left home. He had gone West,
she knew; but he would not now utter a syllable
in explanation, or even say how he had been
employed. Ben could not press her very much
upon the subject, as it was evidently a painful
one. His departure from home had been caused
by some disgraceful, possibly fatal broil&mdash;that was
clear; so Ben forbore to question her.</p>

<p>The day of his wedding drew nigh. Ruth had
left her school; their home was so far advanced
in its improvements that it would be quite ready
by the time they returned from their trip; and
then&mdash;to add still greater pleasure and éclat to
the festivities&mdash;the gallant energetic old gentleman
Mr Bynnes paid a short visit to Cincinnati.
Like the restless Yankee he was, he had already
sold his new estate at a very considerable profit;
so was now, at seventy years of age, looking out
for some fresh investment for his dollars, and
employment for his time. He had seen Ben
before leaving Cincinnati, and appeared to like
him then; and seeing him a little more at leisure
now, he liked him more. The bluff, straightforward,
perhaps rough manner, which Creelock
could never shake off, seemed to please the old
man mightily, and he was never so happy as
when in his company. Ben, with his nightmare
always oppressing him, had asked a little about
Reuben Morede, who he knew was a connection
of Mr Bynnes. But the latter was not communicative
about the new partner, although
there was a tantalising hesitation in his manner,
which made Ben think he could a tale unfold,
did he choose.</p>

<p>Well, the wedding-day came; and the simple
ceremony performed in Mr Showle’s drawing-room,
made Ben and Ruth man and wife.
Then came what answers to the wedding-breakfast
of the Britisher, and this was on a scale, for
variety and display, to put the old country on
its mettle, although it was only given by an
American storekeeper. After the first part of the
feast was over, Mr Bynnes got Ben by himself
and insisted upon having a final glass of
champagne with him. ‘I know you have got
just the best wife in the States,’ said the old
gentleman; ‘and you are the kind of man to
make a good husband, <i>I</i> can see. I feel as glad
to see little Ruth Alken happily settled, as if
she was a gal of my own&mdash;I do. After all these
years, too, to think her brother is going to clear
up and quit his tricks! I always liked the boy;
but he has had some real bad ways. You asked
me about him, you know.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, I did,’ said Ben.</p>

<p>‘Wal, I did not like to let out agen him,’
pursued Mr Bynnes; ‘but it can’t do harm
now anyway, that I can see. He has been
mining in Colorado, and has been up to some
queer tricks there. He was nigh killed by his
partner&mdash;he was; that is so.’</p>

<p>‘Nearly killed!’ echoed Ben.</p>

<p>‘Ah! most oncommon nigh,’ said Mr Bynnes.
‘Also he was nigh upon lynched by the Vigilantes.
His partner found out that he was&mdash;Rube was,
I mean&mdash;playing him false, planning to rob and
perhaps murder him; so it is supposed from
the mark on his head that he hit him down
with some blunt instrument, possibly a club,
and left him for dead at the mine. He was
found lying by some of the miners, who carried
him to Flume City, and I heard all about it
from the doctor who attended him. It is a real
extraordinary case. He recovered, as you see;
but his memory from a certain time has entirely
gone. His boyish days he remembers quite well;
but does not appear to have the least idea that
he ever went to the mines or was ever injured.
We have tried him in every way; but his mind
is a perfect blank. Strange, is it not?’</p>

<p>‘Very strange,’ assented Ben, who, we need
hardly say, was listening with breathless interest.</p>

<p>‘His brain is injured, no doubt,’ continued
the elder; ‘for his skull was fractured. The
doctor says it is to be hoped that he will never
recover his memory; for if he does, he will
probably go mad, and do some more mischief
before he dies. It is a strange case.&mdash;Here we
are! just having a friendly drink at parting.’
This was in reply to one or two of the party
who came to interrupt the lengthened gossip, and
the conference was broken up.</p>


<p class="p2">Often, during his eastern trip, did Ben recur
to the strange story he had heard, and often did
he debate with himself whether or not he should
tell his wife what he had learned; but he thought
it better on the whole to be silent. It was with
a great feeling of relief, however, that he found,
upon his return to Cincinnati, that Morede was
absent, having just left to accompany Mr Bynnes
in his inspection of a property in Colorado.</p>

<p>In about a week after this time, Mr Showle
received a letter from Mr Bynnes announcing the
almost sudden death of Morede! ‘And we had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">{188}</span>
a bad time with him,’ said the writer. ‘Perhaps
it was because we came to Colorado that
he all at once got back his mind; but whatever
it was, he woke one morning like a fiend or a
wild Indian. He raved about the mines, talked
of horrible things he had done; said the fellows
here would tremble even now at Rube Steele’s
name; and we have found out that he, or some
one like him, was known in these parts as Rube
Steele, a year or two back. Tell Mr Creelock that
he was frantic against <i>him</i>. He was sensible
enough in other things; but he was always calling
for his pistol, and vowed that he would
shoot Ben Creelock on sight! Told me that
Ben was the man who had broken his skull and
had set the Vigilantes on his friends. I tell
you, Abel Showle, it was real frightful, and we
were all glad when he died; though my heart
ached for him, when I recollected the bright,
clever boy he was; his mother’s only son, too.
But he is gone now; and bad as he may have been,
I don’t think we will tell Ruth of his later life,
as he had caused her a deal of misery, and she
don’t need to think any worse of him.’<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>The kindly, shrewd old merchant’s advice was
followed; and Ruth Creelock, although she did
not feign passionate grief for the half-brother who
had so injured all who ought to have been dear
to him, yet spoke of him with a softened feeling,
which must have been changed had she known of
the deadly enmity which once existed between the
dead man and her husband.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="MISS_MARRABLES_ELOPEMENT">MISS MARRABLE’S ELOPEMENT.</h2>
</div>


<h3 title="CHAPTER I.">IN TWO CHAPTERS.&mdash;CHAPTER I.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Martha Marrable</span>, a spinster lady of
five-and-fifty, is the last of her race. Her only
brother, Mr Clement Marrable, never married,
and died twenty years ago at Baden-Baden,
whither he had gone to drink the waters; and
her two sisters, Maria and Lætitia, although they
did marry, did not live to become middle-aged
women. The elder, Maria, after becoming the
wife of Mr Langton Larkspur, of the firm of
Scrip, Larkspur, and Company, bankers, of
Threadneedle Street, gave birth to a single child,
a daughter, who was named Lucy; and the
younger, Lætitia, having been led to the altar
by Mr Septimus Allerton, of the firm of Allerton,
Bond, and Benedict, brokers, of Pancake Lane,
presented her husband with twin girls, of whom
one only&mdash;and she was called Amy&mdash;survived
her extreme infancy. It is therefore not astonishing
that Miss Martha Marrable, a well-to-do
woman without family ties, is exceedingly fond of
the daughters of her two dead sisters. She usually
has them to stay with her at least twice a year&mdash;once
in the early summer at her house in Grosvenor
Street; and once in the autumn at the
seaside, or in Italy, whither she goes occasionally,
accompanied&mdash;to the great wonder of the foreigners&mdash;by
a courier, a man-servant, two maids, eleven
boxes, and a green parrot. And as she is very
kind to her nieces, and denies them nothing, it
is not surprising that they are fully as fond of
her as she is of them. But Miss Martha Marrable
is growing old; whereas Miss Lucy Larkspur and
Miss Amy Allerton are both young, and intend
to remain so for some years to come. It is not,
therefore, to be expected that the three ladies
should invariably think exactly alike on all subjects.
And indeed, I am happy to say that there
are not many women who do agree with Miss
Marrable upon all questions; for although she
is as good-hearted an old spinster as ever breathed,
she is, unfortunately, a man-hater.</p>

<p>I have looked into the dictionary to see what
the verb ‘to hate’ signifies, and I find that it
means ‘to despise,’ or ‘to dislike intensely.’ Let
it not, however, be supposed that the word ‘man-hater’
is a stronger one than ought to be applied
to Miss Marrable; for I am really not quite
certain that it is altogether strong enough. She
regards men as inferior animals, and looks down
upon them with lofty contempt. ‘Who,’ she
once said to her niece Lucy, ‘has turned the
world upside down, filled it with poverty and
unhappiness, and deluged it with blood? It is
Man, Lucy. If woman had always governed the
earth, we should have had no Cæsar Borgias, no
Judge Jefferieses, no Bonapartes, and no Nana
Sahibs.’ And yet Miss Martha Marrable can
never see a vagrant begging in the street without
giving him alms. The truth is, that although she
detests and despises man, she pities him; just
as she pities the poor idiot whom she sometimes
sees grinning and gibbering by the wayside in
Italy.</p>

<p>These being her sentiments, Miss Marrable has
not, of course, many male acquaintances. She is
on good, but not affectionate terms with her
widowed brothers-in-law, Mr Langton Larkspur
and Mr Septimus Allerton. She once a year
invites her man of business, Mr John Bones,
of Cook’s Court, to dine with her and them in
Grosvenor Street; and she is civil to the rector
of her parish, and to the medical man whom she
would call in to attend her in case of illness. Yet
Mr Larkspur once told Mr Allerton that this
feminine dragon had had a violent love-affair
when she was nineteen; and Mr Allerton&mdash;whose
connection with the Marrable family is of much
more recent date than that of Lucy’s father&mdash;actually
declared that he could well believe it.
If, however, Miss Marrable did have a love-affair
in her youth, I am not inclined at this time of
day to cast it as a reproach in her teeth. Boys
will be boys; and girls, I suppose, will be girls,
though they may live to see the error of their
ways, and be none the worse for their follies.
One thing is certain, and that is, that at the
present time, and for at least five-and-twenty
years past, Miss Martha Marrable has ceased to
dream of the tender passion. She still occasionally
talks vaguely of going up the Nile, or of
visiting the Yellowstone Region, ere she dies;
but she never contemplates the possibility of
getting married; and I believe that she would as
soon think of allowing a man to believe that she
regarded him with anything but polite aversion,
as she would think of going into business as a
steeple-jack, and learning to stand on one leg on
the top of the cross at the summit of St Paul’s
Cathedral.</p>

<p>And yet Miss Martha Marrable was last year
the heroine of a terrible scandal; and many of
her misanthropic female friends have never since
been able to completely believe her professions of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">{189}</span>
hatred of man. The affair gave rise to many
whispers, and was even, I understand, guardedly
alluded to, with just and virtuous deprecation, in
the columns of the <i>Woman’s Suffrage Journal</i>, as
a terrible but happily rare instance of womanly
weakness and frivolity; and since the true story
has never been told, I feel that it is only fair to
tell it, and by telling it, to defend Miss Marrable
from the dastardly charges that have been made
against her established reputation for good sense
and unflinching contempt of the rougher sex.</p>

<p>Towards the end of August, Miss Marrable and
her two nieces left London for North Wales,
and after a long and tiresome journey, reached
Abermaw, in Merionethshire, and took rooms at
the <i>Cors-y-Gedol Hotel</i>. They were accompanied,
as usual, by the two maids and the green parrot;
but the courier and the man-servant, being
males, and their services not being imperatively
required, they were left behind in London. Lucy
had just celebrated her twenty-third birthday,
and Amy was just about to celebrate her twenty-first;
and&mdash;although I am sorry to have to record
it&mdash;I am by no means astonished that they were
both in love. Lucy, during the whole of the
previous season, had been determinedly flirting
with a designing young artist named Robert
Rhodes; and Amy, younger and less experienced
than her cousin, had been carrying on, even more
sentimentally, with Mr Vivian Jellicoe, who, being
heir to a baronetcy, found that position so arduous
and fatiguing, that he was quite unfitted for
any active occupation of a laborious character.
Of course Miss Marrable knew nothing of these
affairs. Had she suspected them, she would perhaps
have not taken her nieces with her to
Abermaw; for it happened that at that very
watering-place, Sir Thomas Jellicoe and his son
Vivian were staying when the three ladies, the
two maids, and the green parrot arrived. But no
foresight on Miss Marrable’s part could have
prevented Mr Robert Rhodes from following
Lucy to North Wales. That adventurous artist
had made up his mind to spend the autumn
in Miss Larkspur’s neighbourhood; and even
if Miss Marrable had carried off her elder niece
to Timbuctoo or the Society Islands, Mr Rhodes
would have gone after the pair by the next train,
steamboat, diligence, or caravan available.</p>

<p>Upon the morning, therefore, after Miss Marrable’s
arrival at Abermaw, she and her nieces
were comfortably installed at the <i>Cors-y-Gedol
Hotel</i>; while at the <i>Red Goat</i>, close by, Sir
Thomas Jellicoe and Vivian occupied rooms on
the first floor, and Mr Rhodes had a bedroom on
the third.</p>

<p>In the course of that afternoon, Miss Martha
Marrable, accompanied by her nieces, and followed
at a respectful distance by the two maids, walked
in the sunshine upon the hard sands that stretch,
for I do not know how many hundred yards
at low water, between the rocky hills behind the
little town and the margin of Cardigan Bay. The
weather was hot and sultry, and the unrippled
sea looked like molten lead in the glare. Much
exercise was therefore out of the question; and
ere long, the three ladies sat down on the seaward
side of a rush-grown sandhill to read, leaving
the two maids to stroll farther if they chose
to do so, and to explore at their leisure the unaccustomed
wonders of the seashore.</p>

<p>Miss Martha having arranged her sunshade
to her satisfaction, opened a little volume on
<i>The Rights of the Slaves of England</i>, while Lucy
devoted herself to one of Ouida’s novels, and Amy
plunged deep into Keats. In five minutes <i>The
Rights of the Slaves of England</i> fell heavily to the
sand; and in three minutes more, Miss Marrable
was emitting sounds which, but that I know her
to be a woman who has no weakness, I should
call snores. From that moment, Lucy and Amy,
as if by common consent, read no more.</p>

<p>‘Lucy,’ said Amy mysteriously to her cousin,
‘I have seen him.’</p>

<p>‘So have I,’ said Lucy.</p>

<p>‘What a curious coincidence!’</p>

<p>‘Not at all. He told me that he intended to
follow us.’</p>

<p>‘What! Vivian told you?’</p>

<p>‘O no! Bother Vivian! You are always
thinking of Vivian. I mean Robert.’</p>

<p>‘He here too!’ exclaimed Amy. ‘I meant
Vivian. I saw him half an hour ago, with his
father.’</p>

<p>‘Well, I advise you not to let Aunt Martha
know too much,’ said Lucy. ‘If she suspects
anything, she will take us back to London this
afternoon.’</p>

<p>Miss Marrable murmured uneasily in her sleep.
A fly had settled on her chin.</p>

<p>‘Hush!’ exclaimed the girls in unison, and then
they were silent.</p>

<p>Not long afterwards, they caught sight of two
young men who were walking arm-in-arm along
the sand, a couple of hundred yards away.</p>

<p>‘Look! There they are!’ whispered Lucy.
‘Aunt must not see them. We must go and
warn them.’ And, stealthily accompanied by her
cousin, she crept away from Miss Marrable, and
ran towards the approaching figures.</p>

<p>I need not describe the greetings that ensued.
Such things are the commonplaces of seaside
encounters between young men and young women
who have likings for each other, and they have
been described a thousand times. Suffice it to
say that, a few minutes later, Lucy and Robert
were sitting together under the shadow of a
bathing-machine, while Amy and Vivian were
confidentially talking nonsense a dozen yards off.
More than half an hour elapsed ere the girls
returned to Miss Marrable; but fortunately the
excellent spinster was still murmuring sleepily
at the fly on her chin; and when she awoke,
she had no suspicion that she had been deserted
by her charges. As she walked back with them
to the hotel, nevertheless, as if with a strange
intuitive comprehension of danger in the air, she
held forth to them upon her favourite topic&mdash;the
unfathomable baseness of man; and gravely warned
them against ever allowing themselves even for
a single moment to entertain any feeling, save
one of polite aversion to the hated sex.</p>

<p>Thus matters went on for a week or more,
Lucy and Amy meeting their lovers every day
in secret, and Miss Marrable suspecting nothing.
Although she knew Sir Thomas Jellicoe and his
son, she treated them, whenever she encountered
them, with such freezing courtesy, that they did
not seek her society. As for Robert Rhodes, she
did not know him; and he therefore escaped her
lofty slights.</p>

<p>But in due time a crisis arrived; and in order<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">{190}</span>
that the full bearings of the situation may be
properly understood, I must briefly explain the
characters of Miss Martha Marrable’s undutiful
nieces.</p>

<p>Lucy Larkspur has but little romance in her
composition; she has strong feelings, but not much
sentiment; and she is one of those girls who are
perfectly open with their hearts. She loved
Robert Rhodes, and, as she knew quite well that
he also loved her, she made no secret to him of
her affection for him. Amy Allerton, on the
other hand, is, and always has been, sentimentally
inclined. She believes, rightly or wrongly, that
it is a very charming thing to</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">Let concealment, like a worm i’ the bud,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Feed on her damask cheek;</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>and she would as soon have thought of permitting
Vivian Jellicoe to think that she loved him, as
of attempting to win and woo the Sultan of
Turkey. The consequence was that Miss Marrable,
who fondly imagined that she knew all the
thoughts of her elder niece, trusted her much
more than she trusted her younger. She regarded
Lucy as an open book that might be easily read,
and Amy as a kind of oracular voice that, while
saying or appearing to say one thing, might mean
exactly the opposite. Miss Marrable was destined
to discover that she was to some extent wrong
in her estimate, so far, at all events, as Lucy
was concerned; and her discovery of her error
was, I grieve to say, accompanied by a good deal
of pain and mortification.</p>

<p>Ten days had passed; and the two pair of
lovers had made considerable progress. Amy, it
is true, had not declared herself to Vivian, who,
being a bashful young man, had, perhaps, not
pressed her sufficiently; but Lucy and Robert
understood one another completely, and were
secretly engaged to get married at the earliest
opportunity. Vivian’s bashfulness could not, however,
endure for an unlimited time. One morning,
he and Amy found themselves together on the
rocks behind the town, and the opportunity being
favourable, he screwed up his courage, told her
that he had never loved any one but her; and
obtained a coyly given promise that she would
be his.</p>

<p>Natures like Amy’s, when they once take fire,
often burn rapidly. On Monday, she became
engaged to Vivian Jellicoe; on Tuesday, Vivian
begged her to name a day for the wedding, and
she refused; and on Wednesday, Vivian, knowing
the peculiar sentiments of Miss Martha Marrable,
and doubtful also, perhaps, whether his father
would not throw impediments in the way of his
early marriage, proposed an elopement; and Amy,
with some hesitation, consented.</p>

<p>When she returned from her secret meeting
with her lover, she of course confided her plan
to her cousin. ‘How foolish you are,’ said Lucy;
‘you know that your father would not have you
do that for the world; and you will make an
enemy of Aunt Martha, who is like a mother to
us girls.’</p>

<p>‘But she would never agree to our marrying,
if we consulted her,’ objected Amy; ‘and if she
knew anything of our plans, I am sure that she
would manage to frustrate them. She is a dear
old thing, but—— Well, she is peculiar on those
points.’</p>

<p>‘I have told you what I think,’ said Lucy,
with an assumption of wisdom that was perhaps
warranted by her superior age. ‘Don’t be
foolish.’</p>

<p>But Amy was already beyond the influence
of counsel. She persisted in her intention, and
even claimed Lucy’s sympathy and assistance,
which, of course, Lucy could not ultimately
withhold.</p>

<p>Ere an elopement can be successfully carried
out, in the face especially of the jealous watchfulness
of a man-hating spinster lady of middle
age, numerous preparations have to be made;
and, in the case of Vivian and Amy, the making
of these preparations involved correspondence.
Amy, therefore, bribed one of her aunt’s maids
to act as a go-between; and the maid in question,
with a fidelity that is rare, and at the same time
a treachery that, I fear, is common in her kind,
promptly carried Vivian’s first letter to her
mistress.</p>

<p>Miss Martha Marrable without scruple tore
open the envelope and angrily perused its contents.
‘<span class="smcap">My own Amy</span>,’ ran the audacious communication&mdash;‘Let
us settle, then, to go on
Wednesday. At nine o’clock in the evening, a
carriage-and-pair shall be ready to take us to
Harlech, where you can stay for the night with
the Joneses, who are old friends of ours; and on
Thursday by mid-day we shall be married, and,
I trust, never afterwards parted again. We can
arrange the details between this and then. But
write, and tell me that you agree.&mdash;Your ever
devoted</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="A_FEW_WORDS_ABOUT_THE_POLECAT">A FEW WORDS ABOUT THE POLECAT.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Of</span> the several interesting animals which constitute
the weasel tribe in the British Isles, not the
least noteworthy is the polecat. It is at once
the largest and most predaceous of the three
most common <i>mustelidæ</i>, and one of the greatest
natural enemies of game with which preservers
have to contend, and at the same time a most
persevering and successful poultry-yard thief.
It is, notwithstanding all these unfavourable
traits in its character, but scantily known as
far as its appearance and general mode of existence
are concerned; gamekeepers, for obvious
reasons, not wholly unconnected with the animal’s
bodily discomfort, seeming to possess almost a
monopoly of information concerning the natural
characteristics and habits of this somewhat sturdy
varmint.</p>

<p>The polecat is popularly supposed to be, as far
as outward form goes, a larger type of stoat,
while actually it is a very different-looking animal,
although possessing the peculiar formation
of body and litheness of limb so typical of the
weasel tribe. In several details it offers some not
inconsiderable difference from the generality of
weasels. The somewhat more thickly set head
and the bushy tail are the most prominent divergences.
But taken as a whole, its appearance
imbues one with the idea that it might form a
very satisfactory connecting link between the
<i>mustelidæ</i> and the <i>felidæ</i>&mdash;the weasels and the
cats. Hence, probably, its name. In colour,
polecats vary to some extent, on account
of the nature of their furry covering. This
consists of two lengths of fur; the one&mdash;which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">{191}</span>
lies close to the skin&mdash;being thick and woolly,
of a pale yellowish brown; and the other,
long and of more hair-like texture, a bright
deep brown, darkening into a shiny black. As
these two furs do not grow and are not shed
simultaneously, but are regulated in this respect
by the seasons, it is sufficiently obvious that superficial
observation of these animals at different
times of the year might lead one to suppose
that polecats were of various and irregular
colouring.</p>

<p>The polecat is yearly becoming rarer and
rarer in the more cultivated districts of the
country; while its numbers are also slowly but
seemingly very surely diminishing in those parts
which the hand of man has permitted to remain
in a state congenial to its tastes and habits. We
need not be at any pains to enumerate the districts
throughout the United Kingdom where it is still
to be found, because, when the nature of the haunts
which it loves are presently set forth, such districts
will naturally suggest themselves. The stoat and
the weasel are both to some extent gregarious;
but the polecat seems to prefer a more solitary
mode of existence; and it rarely happens that if
some few of them are found to frequent any particular
spot, many more of their kind have taken
up their abode in the near neighbourhood. The
polecat chiefly haunts small dark fir-woods, where
the surface is rough and broken, and much overgrown
with tangled and inhospitable brake. If
such a clump of trees be situated at the corner of
a field or along some irregular farm-road, it has
additional recommendations. In the hilly uncultivated
parts, the streams invariably pursue a
troubled course through rough and broken ground,
where large boulders and low thickly bristling
brake alternate with gorse and bracken-covered
level ground. Here the polecat also finds a congenial
haunt, away from the abodes of man, and
in a situation where provender, in the shape of
rabbits and hares and winged game, is likely to
be plentiful and easily obtained. When nothing
else will grow on the steep and barren hillside,
large areas of oak are often planted, not to grow
into large spreading trees, but only into oak-coppice,
which may afford oak-bark for the tanner,
and firewood for the dwellers in the country.
Amongst this copse the polecat has many inducements
to form its lair, and there it will find many
animals and birds upon which to prey. In fact,
it is not particular as to its haunts, if it can only
be situated in rough and tree-grown parts, where
it may obtain that security from observation and
molestation which seems a necessity of its existence.</p>

<p>The actual lair of the animal may be anywhere&mdash;in
any crevice of a rock, in a hollow
tree or hole in the ground; but the place where
its young are born and reared, is chosen after
seemingly greater deliberation, and with an
evident object. It prefers for this important
purpose a burrow in the soil, and as a rule, adapts
to its use and occupation that of some departed
rabbit. Failing this, it will be at evident pains
to scoop out a burrow for itself; though this is
but a poor affair beside the convenient and more
secure subterranean dwelling usually formed by
the ubiquitous and nimble rodent in question.
But if rabbit-burrows be scarce, and the polecat
disinclined for burrowing, it will perforce seek
out some warm, secure nook amongst the interstices
of some boulders, or beneath some irregular
heap of large stones collected by the industrious
agriculturist, and set about forming its lair in
that. This lair resembles to some extent the
breeding-place formed by the rabbit, but is
usually distinguishable from that by the greater
regularity and evenness with which the dry
leaves, dry grass, moss, and the like are formed
and worked together to afford a suitable receptacle
for the young when born. These are usually five or
six in number, occasionally more, not unfrequently
less. The months of May and June seem to be
about the time when they are brought forth; but
they rarely make their appearance above ground
till some time after they are born. It is uncertain
whether, while the young are being reared, the
male becomes the sole provider of food; but we
fancy not, and that when the female can snatch
an occasion, she exercises her predatory desires in
common with her mate.</p>

<p>Polecats are not by any means night-hunters,
although, no doubt, they filch a good deal of their
prey under cover of the darkness. Their favourite
time for hunting seems to be the early morning;
and as soon as they leave the shelter of their
domain they, as a rule, set off for some rabbit-burrow&mdash;whether
tenanted or not is immaterial&mdash;and
indulge in a run through its winding tunnels.
After this, they will get to some hedgerow, and
hunt it down. If there be any old palings or a
gate adjacent, they are sure to stop and rub
themselves against the woodwork; and if several
of the varmint be together, they may throw off
their sober exterior, and indulge in a little play;
and then they set off in serious fashion to obtain
their food, which they draw, as a rule, in small
portions from many victims. Like all the weasel
tribe, the polecat seems to possess an extreme and
bloodthirsty rapacity. It is never content to
capture and kill sufficient for its own immediate
use, but will destroy often as many birds and
animals in one day as would serve it for a week,
nay, ofttimes for a month’s sustenance. Hence the
large amount of damage this predaceously inclined
little creature will commit. The catalogue of
what is to its taste in the shape of birds and
animals is a long one&mdash;all kinds of furred and
feathered game, poultry even, to turkeys; rats
and some kinds of mice; frogs, eels, and fish.
The rabbit, where plentiful, is its most common
victim, for it finds bunny a somewhat easy
capture in its burrow, where, lying probably unconscious
of impending danger, it may suddenly
find the enemy at its throat, whence in a few
seconds the marauder will have sucked its life-blood.</p>

<p>Possessed of powers of scent far keener than
any hound, the polecat can and will track hares
long distances in their wanderings, and eventually
effect their capture. Upon the little nut-brown
partridge or the more sober-looking grouse it
will steal in the early dawn or at ‘even’s stilly
hour;’ and sometimes, before the former is aware
of the polecat’s presence, it will have, by a sharp
irresistible bite into its brains, transferred it
and perhaps several others beyond the reach
of the sportsman’s gun. Being at need a strong
and rapid swimmer, the polecat has often been
known to take eels and other fish from the
streams; but unless other food be scarce, it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">{192}</span>
usually refrains from entering the unstable element
in search of food. Amongst poultry, its
operations are often wholesale, and must be disheartening
to a degree to the industrious henwife;
for, as we said before, it does not confine itself
to supplying its actual wants, but, given the
chance of some wholesale killing, it indulges its
cruel instincts apparently more for the pleasure
than for the necessity of the thing. It is this
habit, common to all the animals and birds
coming under the definition ‘vermin,’ which
renders them so extremely destructive. One thing
may be said in the polecat’s favour, which is,
that it is a very determined enemy of the
rat, although the latter’s fierceness often prevents
the former from bringing to a successful
conclusion any crusade it may have opened
against it. But the polecat is all the same
a most courageous little animal; and its fierceness
when attacked, the pluck with which
it will fight against superior odds, and the
wonderful amount of activity it can bring to
bear, prove it to be no mean enemy for a terrier
of two or three times its size. Moreover, it does
not disdain when ‘cornered,’ or when its progeny
are threatened, to attack human beings. Under
the circumstances, it is a dangerous creature to
deal with, its bite being very painful and
lasting.</p>

<p>In addition to these qualities for attack, the
polecat is possessed of a peculiar and very disagreeable
means of defence. This consists in the
secretion of a liquid substance of disgustingly
fetid odour, which the animal has the power of
emitting at will. This it uses in case of attack
chiefly by men or dogs; and as we fancy it
is as objectionable and intolerable to its canine
as to its human enemies, the benefit it derives
from this possession may be better imagined than
described. Owing doubtless to this habit, the
animal frequently goes by the name of foulemart
in England, and foumart in Scotland.</p>

<p>No one who has any actual knowledge of the
habits of the polecat can come to any other conclusion
than that it is a most destructive animal,
and one whose presence is not to be tolerated,
much less desired, either in the game preserve or
in the neighbourhood of the poultry-yard; and yet
one of the most ridiculous of superstitions obtains
amongst many farmers and country-people as to
this animal. It is said to be capable of appreciating
hospitality, and acting in accordance with
the unwritten laws of such, so that if one encourage
the animal and afford it shelter, it will
refrain from destroying the live-stock of the
person who so amiably entertains it. This is,
one must admit, a very pretty little piece of
nonsense. But, notwithstanding this, polecats
are unmistakably becoming fewer and fewer
every year, and we shall soon see it a very
rare animal.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright

so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the

Gutenberg&#8482; License.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

provided that:

        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
